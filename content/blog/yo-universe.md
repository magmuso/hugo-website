Yo Universe! This is my first entry to this blog.

This entry is like an 'about me' page. It will be updated from time to time. Although I will try to keep it as close to the original as possible.

My name is Martynas Melninkas and I am a programmer. I find *programmer* the easiest term to identify what I do. This is due to the ambiguous nature of terms 'Software Engineer', 'Software Developer', 'DevOp', 'Web Developer', 'Back-end Developer', and 'Full-Stack developer'. Can I be one and the other? What about all of them? Are they all paid the same (in this case - nope)? While in some cases these terms can identify what are your main responsibilities at a particular company, I find interest in all of them. Also, I strongly believe that one is exactly as important as the other, especially in the world with 'Internet of Things' proposed.

In addition to the programming stories there will be an occasional post about politics and life. I would like to justify why I think the former is important. Politics is complicated therefore interesting. Politics is a tool. Politics is a tool to change the world, to the good, the bad and the ugly. And we are the ones responsible, we are the ones to make change or make-no-change. We have to realise that a *nop* is also in action, a choice. It is up to us to move forward. And I am just a bloke who will try to make some sense out of it all.

See you on another post.

P.S. I am adding an interesting picture for you. Investigate to find more! Hint: TedX
